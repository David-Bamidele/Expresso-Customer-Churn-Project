# Expresso Churn Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for Expresso, a fictional telecommunications company. By analyzing customer data, the model aims to identify which customers are likely to stop using the service, allowing the company to implement retention strategies proactively.

## Project Overview

The **Expresso Churn Prediction App** is built using Python and leverages **Streamlit** to create an interactive and user-friendly interface. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and a web app for deployment. This solution is designed to help Expresso make data-driven decisions to improve customer retention.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares raw customer data for model training.
- **Machine Learning Model**: A predictive model trained on historical data to identify potential churn.
- **Interactive Web Application**: Built with Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the model and view churn predictions.


## Usage

- **Load Customer Data**: The app allows users to upload customer data for churn prediction.
- **View Predictions**: The model predicts the likelihood of churn for each customer.
- **Analyze Results**: Use the insights provided by the app to strategize retention efforts.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Streamlit**
- **Joblib** for model serialization
- **scikit-learn** for model development

## Project Structure

- `Expresso_Churn_Prediction_Streamlit_App.py`: The main application file for Streamlit.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies required to run the app.
- `Expresso_Churn_main.csv`: The dataset that was used for this project
